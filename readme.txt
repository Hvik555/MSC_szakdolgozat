The folder structure is the following:
 - CNNs.ipynb: This is the main source code for the CNNs, heatmaps, metrics, visualization, adversarial attacks etc. with clear outputs (code did not run before)
 - sample: Contains two ipynb file:
    * Test_true_sample_code.ipynb: This code has the outputs for the testing phase
    * All_sample_code.ipynb: This code has all the outputs with dummy values (including training phase)
 - files: Contains all the heatmaps, hyperparameters, metrics, visualization, plots, etc files that were discussed in the Szakdolgozat.pdf 

If you can't download the datasets from the code, you can use the following links:
