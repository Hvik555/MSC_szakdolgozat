# MSC_szakdolgozat

You can use the ipynb files:
 - locally with Jupyter Notebook (in this case you have to install python, CUDA and cuDNN) - RECOMMENDED 
 - Or use it from Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/

If you decide to use it locally please install the requirements.txt with pip (pip install -r requirements.txt).

The folder structure is the following:
 - CNNs.ipynb: This is the main source code for the CNNs, heatmaps, metrics, visualization, adversarial attacks etc. with clear outputs (code did not run before)
 - sample: Contains two ipynb file:
    * Test_true_sample_code.ipynb: This code has the outputs for the testing phase
    * All_sample_code.ipynb: This code has all the outputs with dummy values (including training phase)
 - files: Contains all the heatmaps, hyperparameters, metrics, visualization, plots, etc files that were discussed in the Szakdolgozat.pdf 
 - requirements.txt: The necessary python packages


If you can't download the datasets from the code, you can use the following links (I recommended to use via Chrome):
